# COMP3025_ASSIGNMENT_1110642

This app is called "ASL Butterfly Dictionary". It helps the non-ASL users to learn American Sign Language so that they can communicate with the ASL users. 

ASL Butterfly Dictionary will be build by Kotin programming language. The database for the words and signs in the videos will be stored in the Firestore. 
I will be using Android Studio IDE to build an android app and will deploy it to Google Play.
